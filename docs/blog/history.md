This document chronicles the changes in the main `Bonsai.t` type through
its history.

## Motivation

Work on Bonsai started in late March 2019 after the conclusion of the
first Tools & Compilers teach-in. The 2nd half of the teach-in was
focused on `Incr_dom`, and it gave us an opportunity to look over the
shoulders (literally) of people writing applications using that
framework. One of the main frustrations from the assignments centered on
the composability and extensibility of `Incr_dom` programs, and the lack
of a conceptual "component."

Most of the bugs that were encountered by students in the class were
either due to the application growing too big and becoming large and
messy, or due to mistakes being made while attempting to connect smaller
more cleanly-separated components.

But what is a "component"? When most people use the word, they're
talking about a few behaviors.

1.  Components should be composable. Making larger components out of
    many smaller ones is paramount.
2.  A component should be isolated from the rest of the application's
    code. It shouldn't have its fingers in other components' business,
    nor should it expose too much of its own internal details.

## Bonsai Pre-History

The closest thing that `Incr_dom` has to a "component" as described
above would be the following type signature:

``` ocaml
type ('model, 'action, 'state) component
  =  model: 'model Incr.t
  -> old_model: 'model option Incr.t
  -> inject: ('action -> Event.t)
  -> ('action, 'model, 'state) Incr_dom.Component.t Incr.t
```

This type signature (or something like it) is found in many places
(though never actually given a type), from `Incr_dom`'s own
`App_intf.S`, to the Partial Render Table's `Table.S.create`, to the
internal organization of some well-factored applications written at Jane
Street.

Realizing that this type signature was the "real" component type (as
opposed to `Incr_dom.Component.t`), the first iteration of the
`Bonsai.t` type looked roughly like this:

``` ocaml
module Bonsai : sig
  type ('model, 'action, 'state) t
    =  model: 'model Incr.t
    -> old_model: 'model option Incr.t
    -> inject: ('action -> Event.t)
    -> ('action, 'model, 'state) Incr_dom.Component.t Incr.t
end
```

## Bonsai Alpha

Pre-History Bonsai satisfies the "isolation" requirement of a
component's definition; hiding the types involved could be done manually
with OCaml's powerful abstraction primitives. However, it was difficult
to write code to automatically compose these components.

A good proof-of-concept was a function that took two `Bonsai.t`s and
smooshed them together into a single `Bonsai.t`. The signature looked
something like this:

``` ocaml
val both
  :  ('model, 'action_1, 'state) t
  -> ('model, 'action_2, 'state) t
  -> ('model, ('action_1, 'action_2) Either.t, 'state) t
```

While writing an implementation of this may look feasible, there are
some details of the `Incr_dom.Component.t` type that made the
composition impossible.

### Infeasibility #1

The view that is contained inside of `Incr_dom.Component.t` has no
natural merge operation. Given two `Vdom.Node.t` values, how do you
produce a single `Vdom.Node.t`? Wrap it in a `<div>`? There is no
general, satisfying answer.

### Infeasibility #2

An instance of `('action, 'model, 'state) Incr_dom.Component.t` contains
inside of it a callback called `update_visibility` that returns
`'model`, which is called every time that `Incr_dom` detects that the
visibility of an element on the page may have changed. `Incr_dom`
expects that a super-component will delegate these callbacks to its
subcomponents, and they, in turn, will delegate to their subcomponents.

The way that `Incr_dom` was able to deal with this is by offloading the
"merge two different updates to the same model" complexity off onto the
developer. Since Bonsai wants to perform composition automatically, this
is not an acceptable tradeoff.

### Solution: Drop `<tt>`{=html}Incr_dom.Component.t`</tt>`{=html}

`Component.t` isn't cutting it, so let's make our own type, loosely
modeled on it. It will have fewer callbacks, and a generic return type.

``` ocaml
module Snapshot : sig
  type ('model, 'action, 'result) t =
    { apply_action : schedule_event:(Event.t -> unit) -> 'action -> 'model
    ; result : 'result
    }
end

module Bonsai : sig
  type ('model, 'action, 'result) t
    =  model: 'model Incr.t
    -> old_model: 'model option Incr.t
    -> inject: ('action -> Event.t)
    -> ('model, 'action, 'result) Snapshot.t Incr.t

  val both
    :  ('model, 'action_1, 'result_1) t
    -> ('model, 'action_2, 'result_2) t
    -> ('model, ('action_1, 'action_2) Either.t, 'result_1 * 'result_2) t
end
```

The name "Snapshot" was chosen because it's how I described `Incr_dom`'s
`Component.t` type:

> An instance of `Incr_dom.Component.t` is a snapshot of the component
> at a particular instant in time. Just look at the fields in the type,
> you've got `Vdom.Node.t`: the *current* view, an `apply_action`
> callback which only describes the *current* `apply_action`. Indeed,
> it's the `Incr.t` in `Incr_dom.Component.t Incr.t` that gives the
> component its ability to change its view or behavior over time.

Gone are the `update_visibility` and `on_display` callbacks, and the
"result" of a component is generic instead of being restricted to
`Vdom.Node.t`.

Now we can finally implement `both`!

Alongside another trivially implementable function `map`, Bonsai
components now have a let-syntax for trivial, multi-component
composition.

``` ocaml
module Bonsai : sig
  type ('model, 'action, 'result) t

  val both
    :  ('model, 'action_1, 'result_1) t
    -> ('model, 'action_2, 'result_2) t
    -> ('model, ('action_1, 'action_2) Either.t, 'result_1 * 'result_2) t

  val return : 'result -> (_, Nothing.t, 'result) t

  val map
    :  ('model, 'action, 'r1) t
    -> f:('r1 -> 'r2)
    -> ('model, 'action, 'r2) t

  module Let_syntax : sig
    ...
  end
end
```

Note: At this point, the concrete type of `Bonsai.t` stops being the
`'model -> 'old_model -> etc...` function, and becomes a GADT which is
hidden from the user. Conceptually, though, it remains the same as the
function type seen above.

## Bonsai Beta

After using this form of Bonsai in personal projects for a while, a
certain problem with the `Bonsai.t` signature kept cropping up: the
explosion of `'action` type parameters. Every time that a component
composition occurred (either directly via `both`, or indirectly via the
let-syntax), a new layer of `Either.t` would show up on the resultant
`'action` type parameter. Infamously, a slide-show application built as
a Bonsai demo had a top-level component whose `'action` parameter was
the following:

``` ocaml
 (never_returns,
  (never_returns,
   (never_returns,
    (never_returns,
     (never_returns,
      ((Interaction.Action.t,
        (int Model_editor.Action.t, Code_slide.Action.t) Either.t)
       Either.t,
       ((Interaction.Action.t,
         (int Model_editor.Action.t, Code_slide.Action.t) Either.t)
        Either.t,
        (((Interaction.Action.t, Interaction.Action.t) Either.t,
          (Inner_model.t Model_editor.Action.t, Code_slide.Action.t) Either.t)
         Either.t,
         ((string * Interaction.Action.t,
           (int Core_kernel.String.Map.t Model_editor.Action.t,
            Code_slide.Action.t)
           Either.t)
          Either.t,
          ((never_returns, (never_returns, Code_slide.Action.t) Either.t)
           Either.t,
           ((never_returns, (never_returns, Code_slide.Action.t) Either.t)
            Either.t,
            ((never_returns, (never_returns, Code_slide.Action.t) Either.t)
             Either.t,
             ((Interaction.Action.t,
               (int Model_editor.Action.t, Code_slide.Action.t) Either.t)
              Either.t,
              (((Interaction.Action.t, Interaction.Action.t) Either.t,
                (Inner_model.t Model_editor.Action.t, Code_slide.Action.t)
                Either.t)
               Either.t,
               ((string * Interaction.Action.t,
                 (int Core_kernel.String.Map.t Model_editor.Action.t,
                  Code_slide.Action.t)
                 Either.t)
                Either.t,
                ((never_returns,
                  (never_returns, Code_slide.Action.t) Either.t)
                 Either.t,
                 (((string * Interaction.Action.t)
                   Bonsai_timetravel_example.Time_travel.Action.t,
                   (int Core_kernel.String.Map.t Model_editor.Action.t,
                    Code_slide.Action.t)
                   Either.t)
                  Either.t,
                  (never_returns, (never_returns, never_returns) Either.t)
                  Either.t)
                 Either.t)
                Either.t)
               Either.t)
              Either.t)
             Either.t)
            Either.t)
           Either.t)
          Either.t)
         Either.t)
        Either.t)
       Either.t)
      Either.t)
     Either.t)
    Either.t)
   Either.t)
  Either.t)
 Either.t
```

If you've ever wanted a binary tree of types, Bonsai Beta would gladly
provide.

Not only were the types unwieldy and hard to hide, they were also
practically worthless. Raising another component's action -- while
somewhat common in `Incr_dom` apps -- is better accomplished by having
one component pass its `inject` function to another component. Passing
data from one component to another is considerably easier in Bonsai than
it was in `Incr_dom`, so component-to-component communication by
directly constructing the action type of a neighboring component is
prohibited.

This prompted us to write a feature hiding the type parameter from the
public API via some GADT type hackery, bringing the sig for Bonsai down
to:

``` ocaml
module Bonsai : sig
  type ('model, 'result) t

  val both
    :  ('model, 'result_1) t
    -> ('model, 'result_2) t
    -> ('model, 'result_1 * 'result_2) t

  val return : 'result -> (_, 'result) t

  val map
    :  ('model, 'r1) t
    -> f:('r1 -> 'r2)
    -> ('model, 'r2) t

  module Let_syntax : sig
    ...
  end
end
```

The removal of this type parameter was sorely needed too, because we'd
been wanting to add another type parameter, but felt like 4 was too
much.

### Bonsai Release

The last type parameter is `'input`. `'input` is for data that a
component needs to read, but doesn't require write access to. Prior to
`'input`, users would either pass all their input into the component via
`'model` (accidentally making it writable in the process), or they'd
close over additional parameters like so:

``` ocaml
let my_component something_to_close_over =
  ... construct a component here ...
```

However, this proved to be a nightmare:

1.  Treating all of a component's input as mutable required storing
    everything that a component might want to read in the application's
    model. This makes all input data mutable, and requires severe
    contortions in order to pass data from one component to another: the
    first component would have to write data into the model at a
    particular location that the second component is also looking at.
    This is very fragile in practice.
2.  Passing immutable output via closure made composition harder than we
    would have liked. For any data to flow to a component, the function
    calls constructing it need to be made during the initial
    construction of the app rather than at runtime.

For these reasons, a 3rd type was added to the `Bonsai` signature:
`'input`, for representing immutable input that the component would like
to read but doesn't need to write.

``` ocaml
module Bonsai : sig
  type ('input, 'model, 'result) t

  val both
    :  ('input, 'model, 'result_1) t
    -> ('input, 'model, 'result_2) t
    -> ('input, 'model, 'result_1 * 'result_2) t

  val return : 'result -> (_, _, 'result) t

  val map
    :  ('input, 'model, 'r1) t
    -> f:('r1 -> 'r2)
    -> ('input, 'model, 'r2) t

  module Let_syntax : sig
    ...
  end
end
```

In addition to simplifying the uses of components, `Bonsai.t` gains a
new power: the ability to chain components together, piping the output
of one component into the input of another!

``` ocaml
val ( >>> )
  :  ('input, 'model, 'result_1) t
  -> ('result_1, 'model, 'result_2) t
  -> ('input, 'model, 'result_2) t
```

with this operator, `Bonsai.t` is in the category of Arrows![^1]

This infix operator (found inside `Bonsai.Infix`) is wildly powerful and
provides the 2nd form of composability:

1.  `Let_syntax` or `both`: Parallel composability
2.  `<strong>`{=html}`>>>`: Sequential composability`</strong>`{=html}

And that brings us to the end of the `Bonsai.t` API journey! The type
signature remains `('input, 'model, 'result) t` and although its
implementation will likely change drastically throughout the coming
months and years, this core type will stay the same (I hope).

### Model-less Bonsai

As if to spite me, mere weeks after writing that the type parameter
would stay the same, some of the London T&C team dared me to remove the
model type parameter.

At first I was skeptical, but after two days of prototyping, it was
clear that not only was the removal possible, but that it simultaneously
made normal usage of the library much easier while making most
unidiomatic patterns impossible.

The feature jane/bonsai/modelectomy implements the removal of the type
parameter, changing the core type like so:

``` diff
- ('input, 'model, 'result) Bonsai.t
+ ('input, 'result) Bonsai.t
```

To be clear, models are not going away. Much like how actions still
exist (but don't occupy a slot in the type), models become an
implementation detail of a component, instead of a core part of its API.

Removing `'model` had many effects, some more impactful than others. The
biggest change is that components can no longer share models. Much like
how removing the action type parameter removed the ability for
components to send actions to one another, removing the model type
parameter prevents sharing of component-internal state. Fortunately,
during the tree-smash that came along with the change, I found that none
of the apps or libraries that actually relied on two components reading
and writing to the same model. There were a number of cases where one
component performed reads and writes and another component only
performed reads, but that pattern is expressible with the read+write
component returning the model value as a result, passing it into the
second component via read-only input via component composition.

Another change is that a Bonsai.t value keeps track of its default model
internally. In practice, this means that `Bonsai.of_module` and
`Bonsai.state_machine` have new, required, `default_model` parameters.
However, the application developer no longer needs to recursively
construct `default_model` values for every sub-model in the application
as they climb up the component tree. Composition via `let%map` or `>>>`
automatically derives a default model based on the default model of its
constituent components.

Likely the most visible change is the complete removal of all of the
model projection functions. No more `Bonsai.Model.field`, no more
`Bonsai.Model.f`, no more bugs where you copy and pasted a text box
component and forgot to change the model projection.

Finally, the types that can become models appear to be more restricted.
A model must now be fully sexp-convertible and have a conservative
equality implementation. For most models, these requirements aren't too
onerous - models should almost always contain nothing but plain data.
However, for models that can't meet these criteria, it is acceptable for
the `sexp_of` function to be defined in terms of `sexp_of_opaque`, for
the `of_sexp` function to raise an exception, and for the equality
function to default to physical equality. Together with the default
model packed with each bonsai component, combinator authors have access
to a lot more power to introspect running Bonsai apps, paving the way
for powerful debugging tools.

### Leo's "Wormhole" proposal

#### ACT 1

##### Leo's Combinator Proposal: Wormhole

``` ocaml
val wormhole
  : (read:(_, 'value) Bonsai.t -> ('input, 'r2) Bonsai.t)
  -> ('input * 'value, 'result) Packed.t
```

##### Implementation

During the construction of the incremental tree (what bonsai-devs call
"eval-time"), maintain an environment that maps the "read" Bonsai.t back
to the Incr.t that it is using.

In concrete: a `Univ_map` from `'a Type_equal.Id.t` to `'a Incr.t`.

    ../../src/env.ml

##### Benefits of wormhole: Ergonomics

Instead of threading some extraneous state through the bonsai graph via
arrow combinators, you can use this "read" component only in the places
where you care about the `'value` value.

``` ocaml
wormhole (fun ~read ->
  let%map a = ...
  and     b = ...
  and     c = ...
  and     d = Bonsai.Map.assoc (module Int) (Bonsai.both (...) read)
)
```

##### Benefits of wormhole: Better incremental graph

The graph produced with wormhole is more direct!

    o -- o -- o -- o
        /
    o -`

    o -- o -- o -- o
                  /
    o -----------`

##### Benefits of wormhole: Better semantics

This is confusing to some people:

``` ocaml
let a: _ Bonsai.t = ... in
let%map b = a >>| f
and     c = a >>| g in
h b c

(both (Bonsai.input) a) >>> (wormhole (fun ~read ->
  let%map b = read >>| f
  and     c = read >>| g in
  h b c
))
```

But if 'a' is the `read` end of a wormhole, there's no duplication!

##### Bind-like

``` ocaml
val bind_like
  :  ('input, 'r1) Bonsai.t
  -> f:((_, 'r1) Bonsai.t -> ('input, 'r2) Bonsai.t)
  -> ('input, 'r2) Bonsai.t


(both (Bonsai.input) a) >>> (wormhole (fun ~read ->
  let%map b = read >>| f
  and     c = read >>| g in
  h b c
))

bind_like a (fun read ->
  let%map b = read >>| f
  and     c = read >>| g in
  h b c
)
```

##### Real world usage

        extend_second paging
    >>> extend_second sorting
    >>> extend_second cell_focus
    >>> extend_second tbody
    >>> extend_second merge_key_handlers
    >>> extend_second table
    >>| make_result

    old: ../../../../../../+share+/lib/bonsai_ui_components/src/table/table.ml
    new : ../../../bonsai_ui_components/src/table/table.ml

#### ACT 2

``` diff
 module Let_syntax : sig
   module Let_syntax : sig
+    val bind
+      :  ('input, 'r1) Bonsai.t
+      -> f:((_, 'r1) Bonsai.t -> ('input, 'r2) Bonsai.t)
+      -> ('input, 'r2) Bonsai.t
   end
 end
```

##### Pros

Huge ergonomics + performance win for basically all code that would
currently be implemented via the arrow combinators.

New API's are easy to write, like the following for writing a tabbed-ui
interface:

``` diff
-val tabs
-  :  (module Enum with type t = 'a)
-  -> specialize:
-       (  'a
-       -> ('input * ('a -> Vdom.Event.t), Vdom.node.t) Bonsai.t)
-  -> ('input, Vdom.Node.t) Bonsai.t

+val tabs
+  :  (module Enum with type t = 'a)
+  -> specialize:
+       (  set_tab:(_, 'a -> Event.t) Bonsai.t
+       -> 'a
+       -> ('input, Vdom.node.t) Bonsai.t)
+  -> ('input, Vdom.Node.t) Bonsai.t
```

Using that API

``` ocaml
module My_tabs = struct
  type t = A | B | C [@@deriving sexp, enumerate]
end

tabs (module My_tabs) ~specialize:(fun set_tab -> function
  | A -> a_component
  | B -> b_component
  | C -> build_c_component set_tab)
```

##### Cons

It's not *really* bind? I wish we could use the new let-op syntax in
ocaml.

`and` doesn't work. We'd need something like co-both for it to work? Leo
has a proposal here that I need to read more carefully.

No storing these vars!

#### ACT 3

##### Unit For All!

``` diff
-val bind_like
-  :  ('input, 'r1) Bonsai.t
-  -> f:((_, 'r1) Bonsai.t -> ('input, 'r2) Bonsai.t)
-  -> ('input, 'r2) Bonsai.t

+val bind_like
+  :  (unit, 'r1) Bonsai.t
+  -> f:((unit, 'r1) Bonsai.t -> (unit, 'r2) Bonsai.t)
+  -> (unit, 'r2) Bonsai.t
```

##### Proc

``` ocaml
val proc
  :  ((unit, 'input) Bonsai.t -> (unit, 'result) Bonsai.t)
  -> ('input, 'result) Bonsai.t

proc (fun input ->

  let%bind a = input
  let%bind b = apply some_component (let%map a = a and input = input in a, input)
)
```

##### Proc in use

``` ocaml
let my_arrow = proc (fun i ->
  let%bind x = some_arrow <<< (i >>| a_field) in
  let%bind y = another_arrow <<<
    let%map x = x
    and     i = i in
    g x i
  in
  let%bind z = yet_another_arrow <<<
    let%map x = x
    and     y = y
    and     i = i in
    h x y i
  in
  z)
```

#### ACT 4

##### REMOVE BONSAI.T

It's pretty clear that regular `('input, 'result) Bonsai.t` and
`(unit, 'result) Bonsai.t` are pretty different. Specifically the
semantics of `map` being different on the "read" end of a bind, makes me
think that these should be different types.

``` ocaml
module Fun : sig
  type ('input, 'result) t
end

module Val : sig
  type 'a t
end
```

##### Proc & other helpers

``` ocaml
val proc : ('a Val.t -> 'b Val.t) -> ('a, 'b) Fun.t
val call : ('a, 'b) Fun.t -> 'a Val.t -> 'b Val.t
```

##### Syntax

Only define a let-syntax for Val.t

    moduel Val : sig
      module Let_syntax : sig
        val sub: 'a Val.t -> f: ('a Val.t -> 'b Val.t) -> 'b Val.t
      end
    end

##### DELETE ARROW

``` diff
-module Arrow : sig
-  val first : ('input, 'result) t -> ('input * 'a, 'result * 'a) t
-  val second : ('input, 'result) t -> ('a * 'input, 'a * 'result) t
-  val split : ('i1, 'r1) t -> ('i2, 'r2) t -> ('i1 * 'i2, 'r1 * 'r2) t
-  val extend_first : ('input, 'result) t -> ('input, 'result * 'input) t
-  val extend_second : ('input, 'result) t -> ('input, 'input * 'result) t
-  val ( *** ) : ('i1, 'r1) t -> ('i2, 'r2) t -> ('i1 * 'i2, 'r1 * 'r2) t
-  val fanout : ('input, 'r1) t -> ('input, 'r2) t -> ('input, 'r1 * 'r2) t
-  val ( &&& ) : ('input, 'r1) t -> ('input, 'r2) t -> ('input, 'r1 * 'r2) t
-  val ( ^>> ) : ('i1 -> 'i2) -> ('i2, 'result) t -> ('i1, 'result) t
-  val ( >>^ ) : ('input, 'r1) t -> ('r1 -> 'r2) -> ('input, 'r2) t
-  val partial_compose_first
-    :  ('input, 'shared * 'output1) t
-    -> ('input * 'shared, 'output2) t
-    -> ('input, 'output1 * 'output2) t
-  val pipe
-    :  ('input, 'r1) t
-    -> into:('intermediate, 'r2) t
-    -> via:('input -> 'r1 -> 'intermediate)
-    -> finalize:('input -> 'r1 -> 'r2 -> 'r3)
-    -> ('input, 'r3) t
-end

Bonsai is not a UI framework, it's a programming language

### Proc-like Bonsai and beyond

In early 2020, once again London T&C suggested a change to the API for
the better similar to Haskell's Arrow's "proc" notation that changed
Bonsai's API. Please see [proc.md](./proc.md) for the current (as of
June 2022 at least) state of Bonsai's API.
