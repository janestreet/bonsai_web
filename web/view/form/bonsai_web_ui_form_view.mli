(** [of_vdom] creates a Form's view from a raw [Vdom.Node.t]. [unique_key] is used to disambiguate
    different input fields during [Vdom] diffing and patching, as well as linking a label
    to the input. That is, if you attach the supplied [unique_key] to a text input, then users who
    click on the label will focus the textbox.

    Because unique keys are required to be unique, you should ~always use [Bonsai.path_id]
    to generate the [unique keys] that you pass. *)
val of_vdom : unique_key:string -> Vdom.Node.t -> t

(** [of_vdom'] is like [of_vdom], but allows access to some extra metadata that is stored
    in the form's view. *)

(** [tuple] combines a list of [t] into a single one. *)
val tuple : t list -> t

(** [record] combines a list of fields (field names and their corresponding views) into a
    view representing a record with those fields. *)
val record : field list -> t

(** [variant] takes a selector for selecting which variant case, as well as an optional
    [selected_clause] which contains the name of the currently selected clause and the
    [t] representing that clause's arguments. *)
val variant : clause_selector:Vdom.Node.t -> selected_clause:clause option -> t

(** [option] takes a [toggle] for switching between [None] and [Some _], as well as a
    status for the form. [status] can be:
    - [Currently_some view] if toggle is set to [Some _] and [view] represents the form
      for the type in the option.
    - [Currently_none None] if the toggle is set to [None] and we shouldn't show any view
      for the [None] case
    - [Currently_none (Some view)] if the toggle is set to [None] and we want to display
      [view] when the toggle is set to [None] (e.g. displaying a greyed out textbox) *)
val option : toggle:Vdom.Node.t -> status:option_status -> t

(** [collapsible] represents a collapsible subform. The supplied [label] can be used to
    toggle open/closed the collapsible [t].

    [collapsible_state] can be:
    - [Collapsed None] if the view is collapsed and we shouldn't render any subform
    - [Collapsed (Some view)] if the view is collapsed but we want to render a subform
      in this case (e.g. displaying [...] in a code editor when folded)
    - [Expanded view] if the view is expanded and [view] is the subform to show *)
val collapsible : label:Vdom.Node.t -> state:collapsed_state -> t

(** [list_item] represents a single form in an extendable list.

    [remove_item] can either be:
    - [Remove_info { remove; element_label }] in which case the rendering function will
      decide how to render a remove button for this item with [remove] being scheduled on
      click and [element_label] being called to generate the label for this element.
    - [Remove_view view] in which case [view] will be used as the remove button *)
val list_item : view:t -> remove_item:remove_item -> list_item

(** [list] represents a form for an extendable list.

    [append_item] can either be:
    - [Append_info { append; text }] in which case the rendering function will decide how
      to render an append button with [append] being scheduled on click and [text] being the
      text for the button
    - [Append_view view] in which case [view] will be used as the append button *)
